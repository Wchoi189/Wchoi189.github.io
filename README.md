To publish to GitHub Pages at `https://<username>.github.io`:

1. Copy the contents of this folder to the root of your `username.github.io` repository (or use a `gh-pages` branch with a different repo).
2. Commit and push. GitHub Pages will build the site using GitHub's Pages build. Alternatively, use the provided GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy.
